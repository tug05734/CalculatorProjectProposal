# Calculator App Project Proposal

### Abstract
This is a project that I've had a great interest in since last year. The idea is quite straight forward. A simple android calculator app with a tab that displays many formulas from different subjects. It will let you click on a formula which will take you to a new screen where it will once again display the formula but with information on what it is and what each variable/symbol represents. From there you can input the desired numbers to each part of the formula and it will return the calculated result.

### Relevance 
This project will cover many goals for this class. Although off the bat I don't think it will utilize the more complex ideas such as multi-threading and parallel computing it will still make use of other fundamental ideas. I predict this project will have heavy use of project management, building, and testing. There will be many functions to implemented so effective design patterns and an organized UML will be key. Lastly, debugging will play a huge role in this project. In the limited time I worked on this project, most of it was spent debugging. 


### Conceptual Design
Since this is a stand alone project, everything must be done from scratch. This means the user interface, minimal graphics, functions, and classes must all be implemented as new. My goal for this project is to have at least the equations and calculating the equations completed as that was my original intention. 


### URL Referenece
Since it's a stand alone project there is no reference.
